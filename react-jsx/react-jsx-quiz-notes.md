## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is JSX?
  JSX (JavaScript XML) is an extension syntax for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript

- How does React use JSX to render components?
  JSX code looks like HTML and write JSX within JS files. During the build process, JSX is transpiled into plain JavaScript using tools like Babel. Transpiled code creates React elements, which are JavaScript objects representing the component structure. React uses these elements to build a virtual DOM, compares it to the previous version, and efficiently updates the actual DOM with the necessary changes.
